//STEPS:
// First, we need to import useReducer from React. We'll also need to remove the useState import since we're no longer using it.
// Next, we need to import the two action creators that we'll use to generate our actions: getTopStoriesFailure and getTopStoriesSuccess.
// Next, outside of the TopStories component, we create our initial state that will be added as an argument to the useReducer() hook. We could instead put the initial state in a separate file, or even in top-stories-reducer.js, and import it into TopStories.js. Whatever you do, you should be consistent across your entire application.
// We remove the three useState() statements and replace them with a useReducer() hook, passing in the initialState and topStoriesReducer. We save the state and dispatch function that's returned from the useReducer() hook in the variables state and dispatch; remember that we can call these variables anything so long as it is descriptive of what it represents.
// Later in the useEffect() hook and API call logic, when we receive a successful response or a failure response, we use either of our two action creator functions to generate an action, and then we dispatch that action using the dispatch() function.
// Finally, the last step in this refactor is to destructure the error, isLoaded, and topStories variables from the state variable.
